                        <p> Thank you for visiting my web portfolio! Here is a little about me: I graduated from Arizona State University in December 2017 with a degree
                            in Business Marketing and Political Science. While pursuing my degree I created my own social
                            networking website and mobile app called ASU CHAT that was my primary source of income for several
                            years. I taught myself how to build the website with HTML/CSS and utilized Social Engine's robust
                            PHP platform to manage the back-end functionality. </p>
                        <p>Although this startup wasn't the success I hoped, starting a web business taught me many professional
                            design skills and I started my own freelance Web Design business in 2014. I was able to put myself
                            through college through Web Design and garnered a sincere respect for Web Development all through-out.
                            After graduating from Arizona State University I found myself drawn to digital marketing and
                            web design positions. While I was confident in my design and marketing skills; I knew my programming
                            skills were limited. </p>

                        <p>I felt that I belonged in the web industry and knew I had to develop my skillset if I was going to
                            be competitive for the positions I wanted. I enrolled in the University of Arizona's full-time
                            immersive 12 week Full Stack Web Development program and haven't looked back since. </p>

                        <p>The programming bootcamp was very challenging and taught me to push myself past what I thought I
                            was capable of. In a matter of months I became an HTML/CSS expert and even taught myself SASS/SCSS
                            because I knew I was focused on doing front-end development. I developed a working expertise
                            with frameworks such as Bootstrap and Materialize so I was able to understand any companies code
                            if need be. I have worked with React, Angular and Handlebars so I understand the vast range of
                            frameworks used to create websites in 2018.</p>

                        <p>During the bootcamp I continued to revamp my creative design skills(Adobe) and began delving into
                            the back-end. I learned best-practices when utilizing databases such as MySQL, Firebase and MongoDB.
                            I am comfortable spinning up my own servers and prefer using Express to make the process easier.
                            I thoroughly enjoy progamming and it has become an all-consuming passion of mine. Please feel
                            free to contact me with any development inquiries. </p>
